## Hiii👋

<p>

I'm Sandra — but you can call me ***Sandee*** (that’s what I go by on most platforms). I'm a ***fullstack developer*** with 4+ years of experience building sleek, scalable, and high-performing digital experiences.

I thrive on ***exploration*** — when I’m bored, I don’t scroll, I build. I’ve dabbled in ***mobile app development***, dipped into the world of ***Web3***, and I’m always looking for the next tech rabbit hole to dive into.

I work mainly with:
***React, TypeScript, JavaScript, Flask, and Python*** — the perfect mix for whipping up anything from fast APIs to slick interfaces.

My projects are a reflection of curiosity turned into code — go check out my repos to see what I’ve been experimenting with lately.

Off the screen? I’m likely sketching out the next “this-might-be-crazy-but-what-if...” idea. Or trying to calm mind with a good article or music.
